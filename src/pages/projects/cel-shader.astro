      This is a cel shader that will ultimately be used in a source build of
      Unreal Engine. I've used Three.js here for prototyping as the iteration
      speeds are much faster, while still providing a comparable (at least at a
      basic technical level) rendering environment.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-4">
      The example below shows a comparison between the cel shader I created and
      the MeshToonMaterial included with Three.js. You can see a greater level
      of control with specular highlights as well as different banding depending
      on the light source.
